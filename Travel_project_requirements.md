# Travel Project – HTML/CSS Requirements for Figma Design

Welcome! 🎉 Your task is to turn the Figma design into a working website using **HTML, CSS**, and a little optional **JavaScript**.

---

## ✅ GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

You will build a simple version of the design using:
- ✅ **HTML** for structure
- ✅ **CSS** for styling (colors, layout, fonts)
- 🔁 Optional **JavaScript** for simple interactions like mobile menu toggle

Use **basic clean code**, keep things neat, and name your classes clearly.

---

## 📁 FILE STRUCTURE

Make sure your folder looks like this:

```
travel-project/
├── index.html
├── about.html
├── contact.html
├── css/
│ └── style.css
├── js/
│ └── main.js (optional)
└── images/
└── (put all exported images here)
```


## 🎨 PAGE SECTIONS TO BUILD

### 1. **Header**
- Logo (use placeholder text or an image)
- Navigation links: Home, About, Services, Contact
- Mobile view: Hamburger menu that toggles with JavaScript (optional)

---

### 2. **Hero Section**
- Big title
- Sub-title or small paragraph
- Button ("Get Started" or similar)
- Background image or color

---

### 3. **Services / Features Section**
- 3 or more cards showing services or features
- Each card includes: icon/image, title, short text
- Use **CSS Flexbox or Grid**

---

### 4. **Testimonials (Optional)**
- 2–3 quotes from users
- Include user name and quote text

---

### 5. **Contact Section**
- A form with:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Message
  - Submit button
- Just layout, no back-end functionality needed

---

### 6. **Footer**
- Simple text like: `© 2025 Munga Project`
- Include a few links (even if they don’t go anywhere)

---

## 🖌️ DESIGN & STYLING

- Use **Google Fonts** if needed (e.g. Poppins or Roboto)
- Copy colors from the Figma design
- Use margins and padding similar to Figma
- Buttons should match the design (color, hover effect)
- Use clear class names, e.g.:

```html
<div class="hero-section">...</div>
<div class="service-card">...</div>
```

---
## 📱 RESPONSIVENESS

- Make sure your website works on:
  - Desktop (big screen)
  - Mobile (small screen)
- Use media queries:

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  /* Stack content vertically */
}
```

---

## 💡 OPTIONAL INTERACTIONS (JS)

- Toggle mobile menu with a button
- Add simple scroll animation or a “scroll to top” button (optional bonus)

---


## 🧪 BEFORE YOU SUBMIT
- Does the site load with no errors?
- Are all the sections built correctly?
- Is it mobile-friendly?
- Do the buttons work and look good?
- Are all images visible?


## 🚀 TIPS FOR SUCCESS

- Start with basic HTML first
- Then add styles (CSS)
- Test on both desktop and mobile
- Use **Figma Inspect** to get font sizes, colors, spacing

You got this! 💪
